# Propulsion Notes
Fluid mechanics is notoriously frustrating to master, and I've found myself at numerous points learning 
and re-learning the same concepts. This is my attempt at compiling everything I've learned at SpaceX and 
[MASA](https://masa.engin.umich.edu/), and (hopefully) explaining it in a way that is practical to the 
discipline of stage propulsion, and most importantly, intuitive. I hope you find it useful!
